External Connector Configuration 
=================================
The main configuration file of the **external connector** is the *ext_conn_config.ini* file, but the name can be changed if the configuration file is passed 
as command line option (as explained in :ref:`ext-conn_installation`). Just keep in mind that the file should be always a `ini <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file>`_ file.
In this file you can configure those aspects that are relevant for only the **external connector** such as how to connect with the **engine**, the use of certificates for TLS support,
the logs, different times, the connection with the Redis server (its role is explained in :ref:`architecture`), and other operation configuration.

Engine Connection
-----------------
The first thing you have to configure is where to find the engine:

.. code-block:: 

    # ==========================================================================
    [NETWORKING]
    # ==========================================================================
    # ZEROMQ
    # IP or domain
    ENGINE_IP = 127.0.0.1
    ENGINE_PORT = 5555

.. index:: External Connector Logging

External Connector Logging
--------------------------
The next interesting section to configure is the logs of the **external connector**. In the same way that the **engine** can generate logs, there are several possibilities:

* **Console logging:** The logs are only showed via the terminal.

* **File logging:** The logs are saved in a single file. 

* **Console & file logging:** Logs are saved in a file, as well as shown via console.

* **File logging with log rotation:** In this case, the logs are `rotated <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_rotation>`_ in several files depending on the configuration parameters.

* **Console & file with log rotation:** Logs are saved in several files as described in the previous point, as well as shown via console.

The created log files have the following name structure: ``slv_ext_conn_%Y_%m_%d-%H_%M_%S.log`` (example: ``slv_ext_conn_2022_09_21-08_29_11.log``). But the prefix and file extension can be 
changed in the configuration file. If the specified log folder does not exist, it will be created.

.. code-block:: 

    # ==========================================================================
    [LOGGING]
    # ==========================================================================
    # LEVEL: one of the following: DEBUG, INFO (default), WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
    LEVEL = DEBUG 
    # LOG_Folder: not include the final '/', for local folder use '.' 
    # It creates the the folder if it does not exist
    LOG_FOLDER = ./logs
    # LOG_MODE: CONSOLE (default), FILE, FILE_ROTATION, BOTH, BOTH_ROTATION
    LOG_MODE =  CONSOLE 
    # Log rotation parameters, by default the max size is 20 MB and 5 files
    LOG_ROTATION_MAX_SIZE = 20
    LOG_ROTATION_FILE_NUMBERS = 5
    # Log file name utils. if not used, LOG_PREFIX = "slv_ext_conn_" and LOG_EXTENSION = ".log"
    LOG_PREFIX =  
    LOG_EXTENSION =  

.. index:: External Connector Timing

External Connector Timing
-------------------------
For the **external connector**, timing is an important aspect. Depending on the context, the different values should be adapted.

.. code-block:: 

    # ==========================================================================
    [TIMES]
    # ==========================================================================
    # Timeout for the connection with the engine
    # 5s by default
    ENGINE_TIME_OUT = 5

    # Timeout (seconds) for the external connector (lifespan), 
    # 'NONE' for not using a timeout
    # by default = 1 hour = 3600 seconds
    EXT_CONNECTOR_TIME_OUT = NONE

    # Time (seconds) for main thread operation loop without contacting 
    # the engine in case if there is not
    # information to send to the engine. By default = 5 seconds. 
    # If this value is less than the
    # ENGINE_TIME_OUT, then this last value is used 
    # for the loop waiting time
    MAIN_THREAD_CHECKING_TIME = 5

    # Time (float-seconds) between loops when the external connector 
    # wait for interaction The default value is 0.5 seconds
    TIME_BETWEEN_INTERACTION_LOOPS = 0.5

    # Time (float seconds) between loops for the async thread. 
    # The default value us 0.1 seconds
    TIME_BETWEEN_ASYNC_LOOPS = 0.10

    # Number of async loops to clean the connection register. 
    # It results in a time value depending on 
    # the time between async loops
    NUMBER_ASYNC_LOOPS_TO_CLEAN_CONN_REGISTER = 10000

    # Waiting time (int-seconds) before restarting 
    # the external connector according to 'restart' order
    RESTARTING_WAITING_TIME = 60

    # Time (float-seconds) between connections of 
    # client sockets during starting-up (by deafult = 0.5s)
    TIME_BETWEEN_CLIENT_SOCKET_CONNECTIONS = 0.5

    # Time (float-seconds) between closing a tcp connection 
    # and connecting again for tcp client mode (by deafult = 0.5s)
    # Or initial delay for having enough time to do the 
    # TLS handhsake in the reconnection
    TIME_BETWEEN_CLIENT_SOCKET_CLOSE_CONNECT = 1

    # Time (float-seconds) before allowing the async tasks in 
    # client mode checks if no active connections are alive (by deafult = 3s)
    # Recommended: 5s or more for several TLS or DTLS connections. 
    TIME_INITIAL_DELAY_ASYNC_THREAD = 5  

.. index:: External Connector Operation

External Connector Operation
----------------------------
The following parameters cover other operational aspects of the **external connector**. The first two are the credentials to authenticate the
**external connector** against the **engine**, but if other values will replace them if they are provided via command line options, as described 
in :ref:`ext-conn_installation`. The third one is for being used to authenticate the **engine** against the **external connector**, as mentioned
in :ref:`engine_installation`.

The last two parameters allow to find the custom code that you can add to customize even further the interaction. This is described in detail in
:ref:`custom_functions`.
    
.. code-block::
    
    # ==========================================================================
    [OPERATION]
    # ==========================================================================

    # external connector ID, by default is autogenerated (AUTO, or empty)
    EXTERNAL_CONNECTOR_ID = ExtConTest

    # API key for connecting with the engine
    EXTERNAL_CONNECTOR_SECRET = 3sT0_3S_s3Cr3t0

    # For the hash code sent to external connectors from 
    # the engine as authentication proof
    ENGINE_AUTH_CODE = Y0_s0y_0zym4nd14s_r3y_d3_r3y3s

    # Custom functions directory. The software is going to 
    # look for a python module called with the given name 
    # ('slv_custom_functions[.py]' in this case). If it is not found, 
    # no custom functions will be executed. Please do not 
    # add the extension .py in the name
    CUSTOM_FUNCTIONS_DIRECTORY = ../custom_functions/
    CUSTOM_FUNCTIONS_MODULE_NAME = slv_custom_functions

.. index:: TLS/DTLS Support

TLS/DTLS Support
----------------
In case the **external connector** needs to use TLS for **tcp**, or DTLS for **udp**, this will be the place 
for configuring it. The support of TLS includes the client authentication, as well as the case the private key is encrypted;
but always using material created as `OpenSSL <https://www.openssl.org/>`_ does.

It is important to mention that for the DTLS case and if the private key is protected, a temporary file will created with the 
unencrypted key for the exection and deleted once the execution ends.

.. index:: Redis Integration

Redis Integration
-----------------
As described in :ref:`architecture`, the `Redis <https://redis.io/>`_ server is an important element for allowing to share information among different **external connectors**, 
using memory variables. These variables are explained in detail in :ref:`session_support_and_memory_variables`, here we only address what is the configuration
capabilities to use Redis.
